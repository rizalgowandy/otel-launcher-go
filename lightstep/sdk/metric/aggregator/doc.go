// package aggregator defines the interface used between the SDK and
// various kinds of aggregation.
//
// Note, about the use of Go-1.18 generics!  This code makes use of a
// pattern that gives the SDK fine control over memory layout via the
// use of a `Storage any` type constraint.  The SDK is expected to
// pair the allocated `Storage any` value with corresponding `Methods`
// type, which provides pointer-receiver methods that operate on one
// or two `Storage` objects.
//
// This means there are places where a Storage object appears as an
// generic type with no constraints.  Where that happens without the
// corresponding Methods, it means the Storage is opaque at that level
// in the code.
